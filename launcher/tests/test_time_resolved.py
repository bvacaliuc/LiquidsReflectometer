"""The "Time resolved" tab (upstream add-time-slicing, intake time-slicing-reconcile, plan T8).

The tab follows the launcher's conventions: every validation failure and every reduction error is reported in its
panel, never in a modal box, and never swallowed; the Reduce button is disabled while a reduction runs; the inputs
round-trip through QSettings; the tab is reachable from the launcher. The reductions themselves are stand-ins that
record their arguments (the library has its own tests): this file is about the tab.
