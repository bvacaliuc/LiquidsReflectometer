# Examples

Scripts that show how the reduction is called. Each file holds several examples, one function each.

| File | Shows |
|---|---|
| `example_nr_reduction.py` | setting up a config object and calling the reduction directly |
| `example_nr_reduction_from_file.py` | reducing from a settings `.json`, or from a reduced `.dat` whose header holds the settings |
| `example_nr_from_template.py` | reducing from an `.xml` template, as autoreduction does |
| `example_direct_beam.py` | making a direct beam file |

## Running

```sh
python examples/example_nr_reduction.py                                  # every example of the file
python examples/example_nr_reduction.py example_constant_tof_reduction   # the ones named
```

## Where the data comes from and where results go

No example names a folder. Two environment variables do (`example_paths.py`):

| Variable | Meaning | When unset |
|---|---|---|
| `LR_REDUCTION_EXAMPLE_DATA` | folder the inputs are read from, laid out as the instrument's folder is (`IPTS-<n>/nexus`, `IPTS-<n>/shared/...`, `shared/...`) | `tests/data/liquidsreflectometer-data/examples` of this repository |
| `LR_REDUCTION_EXAMPLE_OUTPUT` | folder the results are written to; created when missing | `lr_reduction_example_output` in the folder you start from |

At the facility the experiments' own files can be read in place:

```sh
LR_REDUCTION_EXAMPLE_DATA=/SNS/REF_L LR_REDUCTION_EXAMPLE_OUTPUT=<a folder of yours> python examples/example_nr_reduction_from_file.py
```

Elsewhere, fetch the repository's test data: `git submodule update --init && git submodule foreach git lfs pull`.

## The examples are tested

`pixi run test-examples` (part of `pixi run test-reduction`, so of CI) calls every example function as it is
written, with the results sent to a scratch folder and no plot window opened. An example whose input files are not
on the machine is reported as skipped; the summary at the end of the run names each such example and the first file
it misses, and the first lines of the run name the folder that was searched.

The examples describe how the reduction is meant to be called. A change to the reduction that makes one fail
changes that, and needs the example's author to agree.

When you add an example:

1. Write it as a function named `example_...` that returns its result. Take folders from `data_folder()` and
   `output_folder()`.
2. Add it to the list given to `run_examples` at the end of its file.
3. List the files it reads in `tests/example_inputs.py`. `python examples/tests/example_inputs.py` prints every
   input of every example, one path per line.
