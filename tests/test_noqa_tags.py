"""noqa hygiene (noqa-sweep) — every `noqa` tag names the rule it silences, and none is dead.

A tag that silences nothing hides nothing today, but it will hide the next real finding on its line. A tag spelled
without a colon (`# noqa E722`) is not code-scoped at all: ruff reads it as a blanket `# noqa` and silences every rule
on its line, whatever code it names. These tests are the guard:
- ruff's RUF100 reports no tag in the files it lints (none names a rule that is not enabled there, none silences
  nothing);
- no tag sits in a file ruff does not lint (`scripts/` is excluded in pyproject.toml): such a tag is dead by
  construction;
- the repository's own selection carries RUF100, so the pre-commit hook and every lint run fail when a tag goes dead;
- no tag is a blanket: each names its codes after a colon (`# noqa: BLE001 -- the reason`).
