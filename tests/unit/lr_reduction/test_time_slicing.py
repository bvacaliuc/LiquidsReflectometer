"""Time slicing (upstream add-time-slicing, intake time-slicing-reconcile): the events, error events and proton
charge a time window selects; how the window travels from reduce_from_file to the file read; how slices are made,
named, reduced and written.

The inputs are **synthetic**. Each test writes a tiny NeXus file with ten pulses, one per second from 0 s, and three
events per pulse whose ids encode their pulse, so a test can name the exact events a window must select. The pulses
sit exactly on the window edges, so the ±1 conventions at an edge are visible (plan L14). The physics of a slice
(NR_Reduction._reduce_single_run) is a stub, as in test_prior_combination.py: its R(Q) is made up, not a measurement.
The window selection, the slice bookkeeping, the header writing and the file and path handling are the real code.

No test may reach /SNS: every path is a tmp_path, and the config's /SNS default points into it (`no_facility_paths`).
